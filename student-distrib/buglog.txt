Bug 1 - 3/20:
    The first bug was in initializing the PIC. The incorrect implementation would cause the program to crash. This was fixed
    by allowing interrups after they were masked for initializing

Bug 2 - 3/21:
    The second bug was in the keyboard interrupt handler when masking was used. The mask was sent to the slave pic by accident.
    This was fixed by updating the address for the output 

Bug 3 - 3/21:
    This bug occured because the keyboard would print the pressed and depressed outputs. This was fixed by adding a range check
    to ensure that only presses are printed
